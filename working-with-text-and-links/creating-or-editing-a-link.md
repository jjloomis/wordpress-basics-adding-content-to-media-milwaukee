# Creating or Editing a Link

1. Open a new browser tab and go to the webpage you want to use in your link. (You can also create links to other **Posts** in Media Milwaukee.)
2. Copy the full **URL** of the webpage.
3. In a **Post**, drag-select the text you'd like to make into a link. **Note**: Link text should describe the webpage that will open when the link is clicked. Do not use phrases such as "click here" or "this link" when creating link text.&#x20;
4. Click the **Link** button in the **text toolbar.**&#x20;
5. Paste the URL in the **Search or type url** field. Click the **Submit** button (arrow.)
