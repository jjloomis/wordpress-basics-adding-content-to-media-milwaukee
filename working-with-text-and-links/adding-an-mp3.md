# Adding an MP3

### Renaming MP3 prior to upload

Renaming an MP3 before uploading it to Media Milwaukee makes it easier to find in the site's Media Library. Renaming an MP3 also lets other users and instructors know who created it.&#x20;

A good approach to follow when naming MP3 files is to use this approach: subject-your-last-name.jpg. If you have multiple MP3 files related to the same subject, you can add a number (-1, -2, -3, etc.) to the end of the file name as well. **Note**: Always maintain the file extension (.mp3.)&#x20;

A properly renamed image might look like this: election-day-loomis-3.mp3.

### Adding an MP3 directly to a story

1. Rename MP3 on your computer (see above.)
2. In a post, click the **Add block** button (plus sign.) Select the **Audio** block.
3. To upload an MP3, click the **Upload** button. Navigate to and select the MP3 on your computer.
4. To select an MP3 from the **Media Library**, click the **Media Library** button. Select the MP3 you'd like to use and click the **Select** button.&#x20;
