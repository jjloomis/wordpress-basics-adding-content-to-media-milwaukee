# Working with Roles and Adding Users

Before adding a user, you should have a solid understanding of user roles. Assigning the wrong role to a user can put the entire site in jeopardy. For example, a user with an Editor or Administrator role could potentially delete all of a site's content in less than five minutes.

## Working with Roles

Always give a user the lowest level role they need. If you're unsure about what role a user should have, stick with **Subscriber** or **Contributor**. You can always give them a higher level role later.

**Important**: Students are only assigned the **Contributor** role. Never give a student any other role.

| Role          | Rights                                                                                                                                                                      | Who should get this role                                                                                                                                                      |
