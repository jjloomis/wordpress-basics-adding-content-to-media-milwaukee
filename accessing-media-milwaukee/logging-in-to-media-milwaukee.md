Use the password you created when you [reset your password](https://app.gitbook.com/accessing-the-news-site/resetting-your-password.md). **Note:** Your password is not synced with your UWM accounts (D2L, PAWS, Outlook 365, etc.) Your username is your UWM email address because it's an easy to remember unique identifier.&#x20;
