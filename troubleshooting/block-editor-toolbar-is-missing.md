# Block Toolbar is Missing

If, while editing a post, you select a block (image, MP3, video, etc.) and the **Block toolbar** does not appear above that block, the **Top toolbar** option was most likely activated by accident.&#x20;

**Note:** If you prefer working with the Top toolbar active, be sure to [deactivate the other View options](panels-in-editor-are-missing.md). &#x20;

1. In a post, click the **Options** button (three vertical dots) in the upper-right corner of the screen.
2. Make sure **Top toolbar** is deselected (no checkmark.) The **Block toolbar** will now hover near the selected block in the editor.
