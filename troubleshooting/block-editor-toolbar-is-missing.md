# Block Editor Toolbar is Missing

If, while editing a post, you select a block item (image, MP3, video, etc.) and the block editor toolbar does not appear above that block item, the **Top toolbar** option was most likely activated by accident.&#x20;

1. In a post, click the **Options** button (three vertical dots) in the upper-right corner of the screen.
2. Make sure **Top toolbar** is deselected (no checkmark.) &#x20;
